    <h1>Instructions for Running bb4 Applications</h1>
    <p>
        These applications will run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you download the indicated zip file,
        <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files">unzip</a> it to any location.
        If the command to run has no parameters, you can just double-click the run script in the file explorer.
        Otherwise, open a shell of some sort (cmd, bash, git-bash, PowerShell, etc.) and cd into the bin directory, then
        enter the indicated command. On Windows, you need to use the *.bat version of the script to run.
        On Mac, cygwin, or Linux, you will likely need to prefix the command with "./"
        since it is probably not in your path.
    </p>
    <h3>Internationalization</h3>
    <div>
        All of these applications are internationalized, and, to a degree, localized. In order to set the locale
        that you want, you can specify <pre>-locale "&lt;locale&gt;"</pre> as an additional argument
        on the command line when invoking.
        Currently, supported locales are "ENGLISH", "GERMAN", VIETNAMESE", and "JAPANESE".

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        I used to deploy these applications as applets and WebStart apps.
        However, that technology fell out of favor and is no longer support by most browsers or recent Java versions,
        so now I use a zip file containing executable jar files and associated run scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
        I recently ported most my projects from Java to Scala, and then later to Scala 3.
        It was surprisingly easy to do since Scala is completely interoperable with Java,
        and there is nice support for converting from Java to Scala in the Intellij IDE.
        <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is an awesome JVM based language that produces
        class files that can be run on a JVM just as Java is.
    </p>
    <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
    <p>
        If you have any questions, suggestions, or problems when running these applications,
        please open issues directly on the relevant <a href="https://github.com/bb4">bb4 project on Github</a>,
        or <a href="mailto:barrybecker4@gmail.com">email me</a>.
