/**
  * Worker is an abstract class that you subclass to perform (usually gui related) work in a dedicated thread.
  * For instructions on and examples of using this class, see:
  * http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/threads.html
  *
  * You must invoke start() on the Worker after creating it.
  * I have modified the original Worker class so that it no longer
  * depends on Swing (hence the new name). I sometimes want to use this
  * class in a server process. So if you are using it on the gui make sure
  * that the body of the finished method is called from SwingUtilities.invokeLater().
